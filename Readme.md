# Facial Recognition Attendance Management System

## Overview
The **Facial Recognition Attendance Management System** is a real-time face recognition-based attendance tracking solution. It leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to automate attendance marking efficiently. The system is built using **Python, Dlib, OpenCV, Flask, and Tkinter** for seamless real-time operation.

## Features
- **Real-time Face Recognition:** Detects and recognizes faces for automated attendance marking.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Uses Dlib for facial landmark detection.
- **Data Handling:** Utilizes NumPy and Pandas for efficient data processing.
- **Video Processing:** Implements OpenCV for real-time video streaming and facial recognition.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Designed with Tkinter for easy face registration and attendance tracking.
- **Local Deployment:** Uses Flask for backend integration and real-time operation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Dlib**
- **Flask**
- **Tkinter**
- **NumPy & Pandas**
